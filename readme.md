## FAQ

(frequently asked questions)

### WHat does this improve

This improves everything a configutraton can: youre gameplay, tyour networking, your interp, your graphics, your framerate, your latency, your fun!

### Why can't I benchmark this?

benchmarks dont accurately reflect the true nature of this configuration. Measuring fps is biased since measuring fps costs fps and hurts fps so it will never be accurate. Many of the changes here are too subtle for fps benchmarks to see and will not accurately reflect the improved latency that the player experiences. I am looking into why benchmarks cant measure this but you can trust me (and your own experiences with this cfg) when I say that this makes the game more responsive and faster and smoother and run better.

### where can i donate items to you for your hard effort

please give them to charity instead. I do this for the benefit of the gaming community

### how long did this take you?

These settings were collected over the course of my time playing tf2, which has been multiple months. it might not look like a huge amount on the surface, but every other cfg that i know of has been tested by me and i tested whenever i moved their settings into my cfg

### what is this licensed as?

idk what licenses are stop asking me

### is this a joke

the only joke here my friend is every other cfg after you've tried this one
